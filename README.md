# Heart Disease Prediction 

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease, based on clinical features.

##  Objective
Build a system that can predict if a patient has heart disease. Explore the data, understand the features, and figure out an approach.

## Dataset
The dataset contains features like:
- Age, sex, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, etc.
- Target: 0 = No Heart Disease, 1 = Heart Disease

## Methodology
- Data Cleaning and Exploration
- Feature Correlation Analysis
- Logistic Regression Model
- Performance Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)

## Result
Achieved 86.89% accuracy using logistic regression.

## Notebook
All code is in [`heart_disease_predictor.ipynb`](./heart_disease_predictor.ipynb)
